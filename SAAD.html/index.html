    <p align="center">Planning for the <u>future is very important</u> for every student. My future plan is to become a
        doctor because
        I want
        to help sick people in my country. After<br /> finishing my SSC and HSC exams, I will try to get admitted to a
        good
        medical college. I know that &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being a doctor is a challenging job, but
        I am ready to work hard. My parents and
        teachers support my dream, and they always encourage me to study well. I believe that if I become a doctor, I
        can serve poor people who cannot afford costly treatments. Besides, I want to take part in free medical camps in
        villages to create health awareness. To achieve my goal, I have made a daily study routine and try to stay
        healthy. I hope my future plan will give my life direction and make me a better citizen. I am determined to
        follow this path and make my parents proud.</p>
